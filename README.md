# Young-Research-Fellow

I was selected for the inaugural [IITM Young Research Fellow program, 2020](https://yrf.iitm.ac.in/), through which I was fortunate to work with Prof. Avhishek Chatterjee from the Electrical Engineering Department of IIT Madras on the topic "Achieving near capacity performance in queue-channel systems with waiting-time dependent errors." 

I designed error control coding schemes that achieve high data rates and make bits/qubits robust to noise in queue-channel systems with waiting time dependent errors by adapting the convolutional encoder and the BCJR decoder to suit this channel.I used Python and Mathematica to perform simulations of the channel, to implement my encoder and decoder from scratch and to validate the performance of the scheme in terms of bit error rates.

The Poster.jpeg file is a poster I made and presented in the YRF poster event to summarize my work.
